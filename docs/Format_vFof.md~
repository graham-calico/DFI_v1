# File Format: analysis config file

This page provides specifications for the **analysis config file**, used by scripts in both the Primary
and Secondary Analysis steps.  This file defines the Google Cloud locations for the input video data,
as well as the output-from-Primary-Analysis/input-for-Secondary-Analysis files.  In specifying the latter,
this config file also defines which analysis will be run during the Primary Analysis step, and in what order.

The **analysis config file** is formatted for interpretation by **python3**.  The files that use it will
interpret its text and then obtain the values that are bound to a set of defined variables.

## Required variables

After evaluation, the python global environment MUST include values bound to the following variables:

**`input_mov_project`** MORE HERE

**`input_mov_bucket`** MORE HERE

**`input_mov_folder`** MORE HERE

**`aInfoL`**  MORE HERE

## Required key/value pairs in `aInfoL` members
